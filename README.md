# Using Survey Data as a Predictor of Pandemic Vaccination
Capstone Project by Mark Patterson, March 2021

## Introduction
We are in the midst of a pandemic affecting all of us… here in the USA and globally. As of March 1st, just over a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen 29 million confirmed cases, and more than 525 thousand deaths -- in the USA alone. Vaccination against the virus is one of the key ways to curb it's spread. In the US, vaccinations began on Dec. 20th, but to date only 15.5% of population have had one dose and just 7.8% are fully vaccinated. For a vaccination approach to work, we need upwards of 80% of the population to be vaccinated. But unfortunately, not everyone is onboard with this. In a poll conducted in December, only 49% of adults under 65 said they were "absolutly certain," or "very likely" to get vaccinated.

So I decided to look to the past, and hopefully gain some understanding around who gets vaccinated and why. Back in the spring of 2009, there was another pandemic - the swine flu or H1N1 virus. It was not as contagious, nor as devastating (about 12.5K deaths in USA), but still a very serious health issue. I found the results of a survey on the H1N1 flu conducted in 2009/2010 by the CDC. So I wanted to see if I could look at data from the past to help provide answers that would be relevant to now and the future. I wanted to understand what contributes most to someones likelihood to get vaccinated, is it about who you are and where you live? Is it about your behaviors during a pandemic, or is it your opinions and attitudes? 


## Analysis Questions
This led me to 4 key questions: 
1) Can we use results of a public opinion survey to predict if people did or did not get an H1N1 vaccination? If so, how well can it predict? 

2) What are the key factors that help predict if people did or did not get vaccinated?

3) Are there any other underlying patterns or groupings that can help us identify who did or did not get vaccinated? 

4) And then linking this to the present… To improve chances of more people getting vaccinated, what questions about the COVID vaccine and vaccination need to be addressed? What are the concerns and misperceptions? 


## Data and Analysis Approach
The historical data was sourced from The National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (conducted by the NCIRD and NCHS/CDC) designed to monitor influenza immunization coverage in the 2009-2010 season. What was interesting about this survey is that it inlcluded a combination of data on behaviors, attitudes, and demographics. The dat set contained 26.7 thousand responses and the responses to 36 questions. The target variable, whether the responddent had gotten the H1N1 vaccination was imbalanced with only 21% of respondetns having gotten the vaccination. 

To look at current day pandemic sentiment, I obtained approximately 60K Tweets about the Covid vaccination from February 2020 to February 2021 (English language only) utilizing Twint to collect these from Twitter. 

I took a multi-method approach to analyzing the data as shown in the graphic below. The steps built upon each other, and also served as a way to corroborate the findings.
